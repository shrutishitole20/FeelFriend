# FeelFriend

FeelFriend is a friendly chatbot web app that helps students with emotional and mental health support. It uses Google’s Gemini AI to chat with users in a kind, supportive way. You can talk to it like a friend, ask questions, or just share how you feel. It also has a BMI calculator that gives you a meal plan based on your BMI.

---

## Features

- **Chatbot:**  
  Talk to an AI that listens and responds like a caring friend. It’s designed to be supportive, empathetic, and helpful for students.

- **BMI Calculator:**  
  Enter your weight and height, and the app will calculate your BMI and suggest a meal plan just for you.

- **Image Upload (Demo):**  
  You can upload an image and ask the AI to describe it (for demo/testing).

- **Text Streaming:**  
  The app can stream AI-generated text responses in real-time.

---

## How It Works

- The backend is built with **Node.js** and **Express**.
- It uses the **@google/generative-ai** package to connect to Google Gemini AI.
- The frontend is a simple web page with a chat interface.
- All user messages are sent to the server, which talks to Gemini AI and sends back the response.
- The BMI calculator and image upload are handled by separate API routes.

- The AI is designed to be supportive, but it’s not a replacement for professional help.
- The BMI and meal plan feature is for general advice only.
